# How to set up an administrator account

# How to use the administrator functionalities 
There are two things that administrators can do that the typical user cannot do:
* They can publish offical catalog flowcharts by creating/editing on of their flowcharts, clicking on the gear in the top right corner, and selecting  "publish flowchart". This will push it into a special database that other users can query. 
* They can view json representation of the course demand of specific quarters. It can be accessed by going to api/analytics/quarters/{id}
