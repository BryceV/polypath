<h1> Poly Path</h1>
<p> 
  Poly path was created by Michel Crivello, Jonathan Pautz, Matthew Jimenez, Miguel Duran, and Bryce Vonilten in the Winter   and Spring quarters of the 2016-17 Academic school year at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The two quarter sequence is Cal Poly's Software Engineering I (CSC 308) and Software Engineering II CSC(309) and was taught by Professor Salome Gudrun Socher, who was a visiting professor from the Univeristy of Munich Applied Sciences. Professor Socher both brought a very realistic stakeholder, who was the office of Registrar, and a professional approach to developing Software a various stages of the Software Lifecycle.

    <strong>How to use the administrator functionalities </strong>
  </h3>
  <p> 
    There are two things that administrators can do that the typical user cannot do:
    <li>
      They can publish offical catalog flowcharts by creating/editing on of their flowcharts, clicking on the gear in the top  right corner, and selecting  "publish flowchart". This will push it into a special database that other users can query. 
    </li>
    <li>
      They can view json representation of the course demand of specific quarters. It can be accessed by going to api/analytics/quarters/{id}
    </li>
