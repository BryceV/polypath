# Poly Path
> Poly path was created by Michel Crivello, Jonathan Pautz, Matthew Jimenez, Miguel Duran, and Bryce Vonilten in the Winter and Spring quarters of the 2016-17 Academic school year at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The two quarter sequence is Cal Poly's Software Engineering I (CSC 308) and Software Engineering II CSC(309) and was taught by Professor Salome Gudrun Socher, who was a visiting professor from the Univeristy of Munich Applied Sciences. Professor Socher both brought a very realistic stakeholder, who was the office of Registrar, and a professional approach to developing Software a various stages of the Software Lifecycle.
 
# Poly Path: Created for Efficiency and Usability
* Currently the Office of Registrar has to manally build the 200+ official flowcharts that contain Cal Poly's 64 major/concentration combinations. 
* The office of Registrar manually creates these 200+ flowcharts in Excel every three years when a new Academic Catalogue is introduced.

# How to set up an administrator account

# How to use the administrator functionalities 
There are two things that administrators can do that the typical user cannot do:
* They can publish offical catalog flowcharts by creating/editing on of their flowcharts, clicking on the gear in the top right corner, and selecting  "publish flowchart". This will push it into a special database that other users can query. 
* They can view json representation of the course demand of specific quarters. It can be accessed by going to api/analytics/quarters/{id}
